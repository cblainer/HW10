<h1>Homework 10: Analysis of Certified Organic Farms Within Bergen County and 10 Miles of Wyckoff, New Jersey </h1>
<h2>Christian Rasnake</h2>
<h3>This map aims to answer the question "How many Certified Organic Farms are there in a 10 mile radius from my hometown Wyckoff, New Jersey that are also within Bergen County?" I used the geoprocessing tools Buffer and Intersection. I used the Buffer tool to find the 10 mile radius around Wyckoff, New Jersey. Then, once I had the buffer in place, I was able to intersect the buffer layer with the selected feature of Bergen County in the county layer.
